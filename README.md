WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours

![Second screen](https://github.com/Modernwyatt/Calendar/blob/master/assets/planner1.PNG)

WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future

THEN I can enter an event
